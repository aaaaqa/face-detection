# Face Detection
Personal project trying to create a live expression detector.

## Current achievements
After completing 50 epochs, the trained model demonstrated a precision of 65% in recognizing facial expressions, while the test evaluation yielded an accuracy of 67.29%. Other machine learning models achieved comparable results, requiring either more epochs or an equal number. This suggests that the dataset quality might pose a limitation.

## Future Implementations
Looking ahead, the initial project envisioned the creation of a live expression recognition system. However, progress on developing this feature has been halted due to limitations encountered with Google Colab and its compatibility with OpenCV (cv2). I plan to address these challenges and resume the project later.
